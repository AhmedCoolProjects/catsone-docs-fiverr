CATS gives you the ability to post to a number of different job boards. These services specialize in publicizing your job orders on the web and in other mediums.

CATS is not an official representative of these services and makes no claims as to their effectiveness. The integration that we provide is merely for your convenience. The pricing for these services varies -- some are free, some are subscriber-based, and some are transactional.

If applicable, the job service listing will include hyperlinks to the service's web site. Please contact or visit the provider's website directly for pricing, to create an account, or with any questions regarding their service.

:::note

You will need to contact any service that you wish to use in order for your jobs to be accepted by that service from CATS

To specify where your published jobs are sent, go to **Settings > Administration > Job Posting Services**. Checking the box for **Enabled** will allow you to send your jobs to that specific site.

Once enabled, you may need to enter additional information such as login credentials for your jobs to appear on that site. To do this, click **Configure** in the same row next to the enabled service.

From the Configure page, you also have the ability to choose whether your jobs are sent to that site automatically when a job is published. To enable this, check the box labeled **Default** and click **Save**.
