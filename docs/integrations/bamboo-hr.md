BambooHR is an HR management tool that tracks everything from the basics (name, address, phone, emergency contact, email address) to training, certifications and licenses, benefits, job specifics, salary, and more.

When the integration is enabled, CATS can automatically send candidate information into BambooHR upon changing a candidate's status.
